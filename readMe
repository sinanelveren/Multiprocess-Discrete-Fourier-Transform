NOTE:
	Program can read and write succesfuly in. file.dat. that happens file lock/unlock sussesfuly.
	Program also write/read M count on temp file named info.txt
	DFT has been calculated and print to stdout correctly acording to true sequence (in same line)
	Process A and B 's log files are updating succesfuly.
	Crtl + C is handled and so processes are exiting succesfuly
